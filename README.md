Customer support API

## Introduction

Welcome to version 1 of Customer Support API. Below you will find a current list of available methods on different endpoints.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

To work with this project you need to have the following installed on your local machine

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) For local development vanilla mongodb without authentication is expected and it should be listening on localhost:27017
4. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## Install and run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abejide001/customer-support.git
cd customer-support

export
MONGOMS_DOWNLOAD_URL=http://downloads.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-debian10-latest.tgz
mv .env.sample .env
npm i
NODE_ENV=development npm run seed:dev # seeds dev database
NODE_ENV=development npm run start:dev # dev environment
```

## Running **Tests**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abejide001/customer-support.git
cd customer-support

# rename .env.sample to .env, and set your environment variables -- no username&password for local database

export

mv .env.sample .env
npm i
npm run test
```

## Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## API Usage

API BASE URL(<https://customer-support-2021.herokuapp.com/api/v1>). It's recommended to attach a `Authorization` Header containing the generated `token` from `/api/v1/auth/signin` to access requests.

## Improvement

- Customers should be able to comment after they created a ticket, incase they figured out the solution to the problem after raising the support ticket, and they don't need further assistance.
- A customer should be able to report an agent if a ticket was handled misappropiately

## Challenges faced

- The report for the previous month is always generated when a call is made to the endpoint to get the report, I initially tried to upload the report to cloudinary but that caused duplication of different reports on clouinary, download as pdf option can be implemented on the frontend.
